******************************* Class Exercise Start ***********************
Create an interactive program.
Ask a user for his/her name. All the following questions and answers should contain his/her name. Also ask for gender (M, F).
Ask for age. Based on age, the program should respond the following:
0-5 : You are too young for this app.
6-18: Oh you are a student
19-40:Well, you must be employed.

The program should provide more details about the age. For example:
If user answers 3, the program should respond: Come back in 3 years when you will be a student.
If user answers 10, the program should respond: Keep up... 8 more years left and afterwards you will make money.
If user answers 25, the program should respond: You finished school 7 years ago.

Also, the program should tell you how old you were in 1980 (if you were born) and how old you will be in 2040.

Then ask the user about his/her favorite season. You have to provide the following options and the user must choose one of them by inserting a number 1-4:
1. Winter
2. Spring
3. Summer
4. Autumn

Based on the answer, respond with a message:
Winter = It must be cold outside
Spring = Ohh, flowers are very beautiful these days
Summer = Let's go for swimming
Autumn = The trees are full of brown leaves

Ask user to enter his/her height and weight. Then find the BMI and print a message:
Underweight   = < 18.5
Normal weight = 18.5â€“24.9
Overweight    = 25â€“29.9
Obesity       = BMI of 30 or greater 
**BMI = kg/meters^2

Now let's find your lucky day. Transform your age to days. Add the digits of the days. If number is more than 6, use the modulo operation with number 7. Based on result find the lucky day.
0 = Monday
1 = Tuesday
...
6 = Sunday
For example 
30 years is 10950 days(1 year = 365 days)
Add digits : 1+0+9+5+0 = 15
15 is larger than 6
15%7 = 1
Lucky day is Tuesday.

The user now wants to go to a club. There is a man in the entrance of the club. Only people that their lucky day is Wednesday can enter. You must also be between 20 and 40. Can you enter? Print the message that the guy tells you at the door. If he doesn't let you pass, he will tell you the reason.
If you can enter and you are 20-25 the guy welcomes you with your name.
If you can enter, you are over 25 and male, the guy welcomes you with title Mr. 
If you are female he will ask you if you are married. If yes he welcomes you Mrs. otherwise Ms.
