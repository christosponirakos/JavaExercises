Create a new program to exercise with LocalDates.
Create a class BootCamp.
This class has 3 variables
name: String
startingDate: LocalDate
endingDate: LocalDate
The program should ask the user to create three Bootcamps.
Ask for name, startingDate and endingDate for each one from the user (keyboard).
Store these Bootcamps in a list.
Then ask the user to enter a date. Check if a bootcamp will be available in that date and inform the user accordingly.
For example, if the user enters 10/10/2020 and a bootcamp is available, then the program should print a message:
Bootcamp SQL will be available in 10 Oct 2020. It starts 01 Oct 2020 and ends 30 Nov 2020.
Otherwise, the message will be: Sorry no bootcamp available in X date.
***Catch any exceptions that might occur. Accepts only Dates in the format dd/MM/yyyy.
***Try to use methods.
